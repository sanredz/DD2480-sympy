Two test cases were added for parsing/sympy_parser.py.

Before adding the test cases, the Coverage report was:
parsing/sympy_parser.py         572 stmts, 35 miss, 94% cover

After adding the test cases, the Coverage report was:
parsing/sympy_parser.py:        572 stmts, 32 miss, 94% cover

Thus, it can be concluded that the tests have covered three more statements, which represents an increase of .52 % 
of test coverage, which is not shown as an increase by Coverage due to rounding.
