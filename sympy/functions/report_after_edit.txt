The added tests covered branches #6 and #7 as identified by the manual branch coverage.

Manual inspection tool:
eval@607-744 ./elementary/trigonometric.py
Branch coverage: 0.953125
Branches not taken: [20, 24, 27]

This means that the branch coverage for the specific function was increased by about 3 % (1/32 to be specific).
By inspecting the branch coverage reports (report_branch.txt and report_after_branch.txt), 
one can see that the missed branches (in the entire trigonometric.py file) have been reduced from 104 to 102, 
although the percentage stays the same since Coverage measures the entire file, and not this individual function.
